**Easy Biodiversity Information Standards**

The [Biodiversity Information Standards](http://www.tdwg.org) Group - commonly
known as TDWG - develops and standards for sharing biodiversity information.
`{tawnydragon}` is a fast and tidy R interface to those standards.

The package name refers is one common name for *Ctenophorus decresii*, a species 
whose common name happens to contain all of the letters in TDWG (albeit not in 
order!)

To install from GitHub:
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("AtlasOfLivingAustralia/tawnydragon")
```

You can use `tawnydragon` to show data from the TDWG information hierarchy,
which starts with `standards` and moves down through `vocabularies`, `termlists`
and finally `terms`. These functions have the prefix `show_`. To show available 
standards (including past versions), for example, you use:
```{r}
library(tawnydragon)
show_standards()
```

All functions in `tawnydragon`, and all `show_` functions return information in
reverse chronological order (i.e. most recent first). For obvious reasons, 
these tibbles get larger the lower down in the hierarchy you go.

```{r}
show_terms()
```

Of course, looking at all past and present terms for any standard is not 
especially useful; It makes more sense to choose a single standard and version,
and show only those terms within it. To pipe these tibbles together in the 
correct order, you start with a call to `tdwg()` then pipe your levels together
with `tdwg_` functions. All functions accept arguments to pass to 
`dplyr::filter()`. If you end the pipe with `summarize()`, only the `terms`
slot of the `tdwg` object will be returned.

```{r}
tdwg() |>
  tdwg_standards(label == "Darwin Core",
                 status == "recommended") |>
  tdwg_terms(type == "term") |>
  summarize()
```
